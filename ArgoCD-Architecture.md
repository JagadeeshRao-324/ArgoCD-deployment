## 🧩 **Argo CD Architecture Overview**

Argo CD is a Kubernetes-native **GitOps controller** that continuously **synchronizes the desired state** (stored in Git) with the **live state** (in the Kubernetes cluster). It has several core components working together:

---

## 🔧 **1. API Server (`argocd-server`)**

### ✅ Functionality:

* **Main entry point** for UI, CLI, and REST API requests
* Handles **authentication and authorization** (e.g., OAuth, SSO, RBAC)
* Serves the **Web UI**
* Communicates with the Redis cache and the Argo CD controller

> Think of it as the **frontend & access layer** of Argo CD.

---

## ⚙️ **2. Application Controller (`argocd-application-controller`)**

### ✅ Functionality:

* Core **reconciliation engine** in Argo CD
* Continuously compares the **live state** in the cluster with the **desired state** in Git
* If out of sync, it **triggers sync operations** (e.g., apply, delete, update resources)
* Supports features like **auto-sync**, **self-healing**, **pruning**, and **health status checks**

> This is the **brains of Argo CD** — ensuring Git is the single source of truth.

---

## 🔄 **3. Repository Server (`argocd-repo-server`)**

### ✅ Functionality:

* **Clones and fetches manifests** from Git repositories (Helm, Kustomize, raw YAML, etc.)
* **Renders templates** using Helm, Kustomize, Jsonnet, or plain YAML
* Performs **manifest generation**, which is sent to the controller for comparison and deployment

> This component **interacts directly with Git** and prepares the manifests for deployment.

---

## 🗂️ **4. Redis**

### ✅ Functionality:

* **Caching layer** used by Argo CD components (especially the API server)
* Stores metadata like Git state, cluster state, sync status, etc.
* Improves UI and API response performance

> Helps Argo CD stay fast and responsive without constantly hitting Git or Kubernetes APIs.

---

## 🔐 **5. Dex (Optional – SSO Provider)**

### ✅ Functionality:

* Acts as an **OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider**
* Enables integration with **SSO providers** (e.g., GitHub, Google, LDAP, Okta)
* Used only if you enable **SSO login** to Argo CD

> This component is optional but essential for enterprise-grade **auth integration**.

---

## 📡 **6. CLI / Web UI / REST API**

* `argocd` CLI tool: Used for interacting with Argo CD from the terminal
* Web UI: Dashboard for managing apps, viewing diffs, logs, etc.
* REST API: Allows programmatic access and automation

> These interfaces **connect to the API server** to manage applications.

---

## 🌐 **7. Kubernetes Clusters (Destinations)**

* Argo CD supports **multi-cluster deployments**.
* It uses **service accounts and kubeconfigs** to deploy applications to registered clusters.

> Each application has a `--dest-server` and `--dest-namespace` to define the deployment target.

---

## 🔁 **Argo CD Workflow Summary**

1. Git repo has application manifests (YAML, Helm, etc.)
2. `argocd-repo-server` fetches and renders them
3. `application-controller` compares rendered manifests with the live state
4. If different, it syncs them (if auto-sync is enabled or triggered manually)
5. `argocd-server` presents the UI/CLI interface and handles auth
6. `Redis` helps cache data and speed up performance
